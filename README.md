# ANN-using-Numpy
This is a basic implementation of feed forward Network using only Numpy.<br>
This repo contains code that i learned in  Coursera deeplearning.ai specialization course1 Neural Networks and Deep learning.<br>
the Network is hardcoded to have softmax at the output layer though this can because Logarithmic loss is used.<br>
Furthermore the Data used in this repo is MNIST image data available at this link:http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ including instructions to downloading and using it.
